# Weight Tracker App #

### Weight logging application to track weight loss / gain ###

This is a full stack web application to be used to keep a persistent record of weight gain / loss.
The app calculates the users BMI score and outputs it, along with adding each new weight to a line graph so that the user can easily see trends and patterns.

I built this application as a learning experiance, having never worked with a database or backend language before. This project allowed me to develop my understanding of the full stack environment, and how to store data correctly.

The app has full CRUD capabilities, allowing users to create, read, update and delete their weight records. Additonally users are able to view and update thier profile data, editing thier height, age, weight and gender; some of which have an impact on the BMI score.

I aimed to produce a well organised project, and learn about RESTful routing in the process. Overall this project has been a success. I've learned and practiced alot of different concepts and technologies which I do not use in my day job as a Software Developer producing educational training aids.

I built this application using the following:
*   Node.js - using the express framework
*   MongoDB - utilising mongoose to interact with the database
*   EJS - as the templating engine
*   CSS - using the Bootstrap 4 framework
